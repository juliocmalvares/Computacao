i went see movi i alway like kevin costner. i felt ashton great job butterfli effect. unfortunately, even though two actor were/ar capabl good great act moment miss here. some scene believ enough stori line support.<br /><br />though movi claim influenc hurrican katrina aftermath, littl (none) effect movie.<br /><br />overall, i like fact movi brought forward goe save live water perspective.<br /><br />the special effect pretti good littl intimidating. not sure i'll ever go deep sea fish again...<br /><br />i expect littl emot film presented.<br /><br />definit movi could'v seen dvd.
